Game action workflow:

1. Implement the action in the Java file.
2. Create a JSON payload class
3. Create a method in Game that will handle an incoming JSON message.
4. Return an informative message to the POST
5. If action successful send to all, if action failed send to sender:
 - the updated board,
 - a notification message about the action,
 - the game status,
 - a status submessage (whose turn, who won, etc.)
6. Set up POST routes in Application.java
